      <GuideSection title="Does Diffdump upload GitHub diffs?">
        <p>
          No. GitHub diffs are requested by your browser directly from GitHub’s
          API and rendered locally. Diffdump does not receive or store the
          fetched diff or your review drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Private repositories and review submission require a GitHub personal
          access token. The token is stored in browser local storage and sent
          only to GitHub’s API.
