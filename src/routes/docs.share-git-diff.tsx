        <p>
          Raw shared diffs are stored in a private Cloudflare R2 bucket under a
          random 96-bit URL slug. Each request checks the stored expiration
          time, so links stop working after 24 hours. An R2 lifecycle rule
          deletes the expired objects afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Links are unlisted rather than access-controlled: anyone who has the
          URL can open the diff. Remove credentials, private keys, and other
          secrets before sharing.

      <GuideSection title="Expand unchanged lines from GitHub">
        <p>
          Terminal uploads can include a GitHub repository and full base commit
          SHA. When a reviewer expands collapsed context, their browser fetches
          the base file directly from GitHub and applies the shared patch
          locally. Public repositories work anonymously; private repositories
          use the reviewer’s locally saved GitHub token.{' '}
          <code className="font-mono text-foreground">core.quotepath=off</code>{' '}
          keeps non-ASCII file paths literal in the patch so their context stays
          expandable.
